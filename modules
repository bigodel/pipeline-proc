A MIPS monocycle processor in SystemC typically consists of the following
modules:

- [X] Instruction Memory (IM): It stores the instructions to be executed by the
  processor.

- [X] Register File (RF): It stores the general-purpose registers and provides
  read and write access to them.

- [X] ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit): It performs arithmetic and logical operations
  on data.

- [X] Data Memory (DM): It stores data used by the program and provides read and
  write access to it.

- [ ] Control Unit (CU): It generates control signals based on the current
  instruction being executed.

- [ ] Sign Extension Unit (SE): It sign-extends the immediate value of the
  current instruction to 32 bits.

- [ ] Shift Left 2 Unit (SL2): It shifts the immediate value of the current
  instruction left by 2 bits to create the memory address.

- [X] Program Counter (PC): It stores the address of the current instruction
  being executed and updates it to the address of the next instruction.

- [X] Multiplexer (MUX): It selects between different sources of input data
  based on control signals.

- [X] Adder: It performs arithmetic addition of two numbers.
